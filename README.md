# zotero-picker package


## Why

To facilitate citation insertion for those who write in markdown and use Zotero.

Now you can write your research papers in markdown,
and insert your citations using [Zotero picker plugin](https://atom.io/packages/zotero-picker) for Atom.

## What

- Invokes the Zotero visual picker (with `alt+z` hotkey).
- Inserts the citations key(s) by preceding (each) with an `@` character.
If multiple items are cited via the picker, a `;` inserted in between,
as [suggested](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations) by Pandoc:
```Citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons.```
- Zotero picker does not put the square brackets because it is much easier to add a bracket pair (single key stroke in Atom) than removing them (as sometimes [intended](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations)).

Note: Zotero-picker just inserts the citation keys, not the bibliography. Read the next section to learn how to get bibliography into your output file.

## How

First, [Better Bibtex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex) plugin should be installed to create citation keys and better be configured to auto-export your `bib` file(s).
You can configure Better Bibtex plugin so that it auto-exports your Zotero library as a `bib` file every time you make a change on it:

Using `Zotero-picker` then you can insert your citation keys (when Zotero standalone is running in the background). Note that it does not insert the bibliography itself; [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) will do that for you once you have your `markdown` (e.g. `input.md`) and `bibliography` (e.g. `mybib.bib`) files ready.
You can create your `pdf` from `md` using `pandoc` with a simple command then:

    pandoc input.md --bibliography=mybib.bib -o output.pdf

Note: In case you need it, you can see the citation key values of your items in Zotero Info pane (these values are auto-generated by [Better Bib(La)TeX for Zotero](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex)):
