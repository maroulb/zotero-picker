# zotero-picker package

## Why

To facilitate citation insertion for those who write in markdown and use Zotero.

One can then simply create latex/pdf with pandoc:

    pandoc input.md --bibliography=mybib.bib -o output.pdf

## What

Invokes the Zotero visual picker.
Inserts the citations key(s) preceded with `@`.
If multiple items are cited via the picker, a `;` inserted in between,
as [suggested](http://pandoc.org/demo/example19/Extension-citations.html) by Pandoc:

    Citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons.

Note: `alt+z` is the short way to get to the picker.

## Required

- Zotero should be running in the background.
- Citation keys should've been generated
