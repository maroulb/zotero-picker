# zotero-picker package

## Why

To facilitate citation insertion for those who write in markdown.

One can then simply create latex/pdf with pandoc:

    pandoc input.md --bibliography=mybib.bib -o output.pdf

## What

Invokes the Zotero visual picker.
Inserts the citations key preceded with '@'.

Note: `alt+z` is the short way to get to the picker.

## Required

- Zotero should be running in the background.
- Citation keys should've been generated
